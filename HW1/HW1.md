# Requirements Checklist
1. Make sure the width matches the device width (hint: see "Responsive Design" slides from class). 0.5 mark
2. HTML must be semantic - that means the elements used should correctly describe their content, and no presentational elements or attributes may be used (for example, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<div style="color: blue;">`, etc). All of the appearance should be written with CSS. 1 mark
3. When your playlist.html file is loaded in the browser, it must look the same as the mocks above (although does not need to be perfect down to the last pixel). 5 marks
4. The header bar must remain at the top of the page - please demonstrate this by having enough songs on the page that the page must scroll down (hint: see `position: fixed` for the header, and `overflow: scroll` for the list of songs). 0.5 mark
5. When clicking on a playlist, the background of that row should become a darker shade of purple (hint: look into the `:active` selector to do this in CSS without the use of JavaScript). 1 mark
6. Layout must look correct on a variety of mobile screen sizes (hint: use the device toolbar in Chrome DevTools to emulate iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and Nexus 5X). 1 mark
7. Passing the HTML into an HTML Validator should return no warnings or errors. 1 mark.

# Summary
I did all the requirements on the above, I found out using Chrome DevTools to emulate mobile screen was a little bit different on the real mobile device. So I did the test on my phone and made it fully functional.
